> Writing computer software is one of the purest creative activities in the history of the human race. Programmers aren't bound by practical limitations such as the laws of physics; we can create exciting virtual worlds with behaviors that could never exist in the real world. Programming doesn't require great physical skill or coordination like ballet or basketball. All programming requires is a creative mind and the ability to organize your thoughts. If you can visualize a system, you can probably implement it in a computer program.

Moving pixels since 2016.

As a software engineer specializing in front-end web development, I create accessible, intuitive, and responsive user interfaces that blend clean, modern design with cutting-edge technologies.
My keen interest in working with global platforms allows me to apply my skills to projects that reach a diverse, worldwide audience.
While my experience spans the full stack, my passion for design drives me to excel in front-end performance optimization, enhancing user experience through fast load times and seamless interactions. With a meticulous eye for detail, I strive to deliver projects that are not only highly functional but beautifully crafted.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend and our playful Pomeranian, BalÃº.
